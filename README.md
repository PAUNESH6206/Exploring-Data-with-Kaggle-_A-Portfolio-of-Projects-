# Electric Battery Charging Time Estimation
This project provides an estimation model for calculating the charging time of electric vehicle (EV) batteries. It uses data processing, machine learning, and visualization techniques to predict how long it will take for an electric battery to charge under various conditions.

Project Overview
Electric vehicles are becoming more popular, and charging times are a critical factor in adoption. This project aims to build a model that can estimate battery charging times based on key parameters such as battery capacity, current charge level, and charging power.

# Installation
To set up and run this project locally, follow the instructions below:

1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the GitHub repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/electric-battery-charging-time-estimation.git
cd electric-battery-charging-time-estimation
2. Set Up a Virtual Environment
Itâ€™s recommended to use a virtual environment to isolate the project dependencies. You can set up one using venv or conda.

Using venv:
bash
Copy code
# Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv env

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows
.\env\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source env/bin/activate
Using conda:
bash
Copy code
# Create a new conda environment
conda create --name battery_estimation python=3.8

# Activate the environment
conda activate battery_estimation
3. Install Dependencies
Once the virtual environment is active, install the required Python packages listed in requirements.txt:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
If you haven't created a requirements.txt file yet, you can generate it using:

bash
Copy code
pip freeze > requirements.txt
4. Launch Jupyter Notebook
To run the Jupyter notebook for this project:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook Electric\ Battery\ Charging\ Time\ Estimation.ipynb
This will open the notebook in your default web browser, where you can explore the project.
